# Excutive Summary
This report analyzes Netflix's Top 10 data to highlight successes in original content production, supporting the Public Relations team’s efforts to showcase Netflix’s “gourmet cheeseburgers”—high-quality, mass-appeal content. We will acquire and clean the data, perform exploratory data analysis, and prepare press releases to highlight Netflix’s global impact.

# Data Acquisition
We begin by downloading the Netflix Top 10 data from the specified URLs into TSV files stored in the `data/mp01` directory.
```{r}
if(!dir.exists(file.path("data", "mp01"))){
  dir.create(file.path("data", "mp01"), showWarnings=FALSE, recursive=TRUE)
}

GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "global_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-global.tsv", 
                destfile=GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME <- file.path("data", "mp01", "country_top10_alltime.csv")

if(!file.exists(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)){
  download.file("https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/data/all-weeks-countries.tsv", 
                destfile=COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME)
}

```
# Data Import and Preparation
We import the global and country-specific Top 10 data using `read_tsv` from the `readr` package and clean the data as required.

## Global Top 10 Data
The `season_title` column contains `"N/A"` for films, which we convert to proper `NA` values.
```{r}
#| message: false
if(!require("tidyverse")) install.packages("tidyverse")
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
if (!require("DT")) install.packages('DT')
library(DT)
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(GLOBAL_TOP_10_FILENAME)

GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
  mutate(season_title = if_else(season_title == "N/A", NA_character_, season_title))

```

## Country Top 10 Data
We import the country data, ensuring `"N/A"` values are read as `NA` using the `na` argument in `read_tsv`.
```{r}
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- read_tsv(COUNTRY_TOP_10_FILENAME, na = "N/A", show_col_types = FALSE)

```

# Initial Data Exploration
To facilitate analysis, we create a function to format column names into title case for publication-quality tables. We also prepare an interactive table using the `DT` package, converting runtime to minutes and removing unnecessary columns like `season_title` and `runtime` in Global Top 10 Data.
```{r}
library(stringr)
format_titles <- function(df){
  colnames(df) <- str_replace_all(colnames(df), "_", " ") |> str_to_title()
  df
}
```

Here’s a sample of the formatted global data:
```{r}
GLOBAL_TOP_10 <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
  mutate(`Runtime (Minutes)` = round(60 * runtime)) |>
  select(-season_title, -runtime) |>
  format_titles()

GLOBAL_TOP_10 |> 
  head(n = 20) |>
  datatable(options = list(searching = FALSE, info = FALSE)) |>
  formatRound(c('Weekly Hours Viewed', 'Weekly Views'))

```

Here’s a sample of the formatted country data:
```{r}
COUNTRY_TOP_10 <- COUNTRY_TOP_10 |> 
  format_titles()
  
COUNTRY_TOP_10 |>
  head(n=20) |>
  datatable(options=list(searching=FALSE, info=FALSE)) 

```
# Top 10 Global Netflix Shows by Weeks
```{r}
library(ggplot2)
TOP_10_SHOWS <- GLOBAL_TOP_10 |>
  group_by(`Show Title`) |>
  summarise(`Total Weeks` = sum(`Cumulative Weeks In Top 10`, na.rm = TRUE)) |>
  arrange(desc(`Total Weeks`)) |>
  slice_head(n = 10)

ggplot(data = TOP_10_SHOWS, aes(x = reorder(`Show Title`, -`Total Weeks`), y = `Total Weeks`)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#FF6B6B", color = "#C0392B") +
  labs(
    title = "Top 10 Netflix Shows by Weeks",
    x = "Show Title",
    y = "Weeks in Global Top 10"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(
    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5)
  )
```
